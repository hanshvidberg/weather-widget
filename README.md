This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Weather widget
This application is a React application that is serverside rendered.
It will get the weather from Copenhagen when launched, and works with js disabled.

To begin run `npm install` and then `npm start`. This will compile the app and launch the server on port `8080`

Focus on this assignment has been to
- make sure it is serverside rendered
- works without js
- update querystring parameter to get a sharable link

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will compile the app for production and will start serving the app.
